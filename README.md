Fire Fox
=========

The goal of this project is to automatically install and configure firefox according to a users preferences.

Requirements
------------

An inventory file with an entry for desktop should exist

Role Variables
--------------

A description of the settable variables for this role should go here, including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as well.

Dependencies
------------

No Dependencies

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: desktop
      roles:
        - role: firefox
